# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to build a website using HTML and JavaScript that allows users to search UFO sighting data based on date, location and shape. The website will be customized using Bootstrap and the D3 JS library to add functionality. Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended. As a next step, she’d like to gain more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter through different criteria at the same time.

## Results
The resulted website shows the following drop down menu for filtering the results based on different criterias

## Summary
Overall, the webpage can be uupdated with new improvements to help the user gain more usefull knowledge about UFO sightings. The current page dsplays the full table by default, this can be difficult for some users. The new improvements could include allowing the users to search for a specific date and time ranges. Also, dropdown menus can be helpful in providing suggestions while entering the data in filters.
